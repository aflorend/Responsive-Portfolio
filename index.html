			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr>
			<img id="profile-pic" src="assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" width="200" alt="Angelo profile pic" title="Angelo profile pic">
			<p>Angelo has worked in business development with tech and biotech companies for years and is now rolling up his sleeves to learn how to code at Northwestern. While working on his honors degree in Biotechnology with a minor in Philosophy at the University of Waterloo, he spent most of his free time holding editorial positions at the student newspaper.</p>
			
			<p>Out of school, he began his career in business development and joined a biotech startup where he worked with forensic labs and hospitals across Canada. He later moved into analytical labs and worked with the world’s largest engineering firms. Finally, after moving to Chicago, he transitioned into tech where he has served as a Major Accounts Exec at one of Chicago’s largest tech companies and as the Regional Sales Exec at a plucky EdTech startup.</p>
			
			<p>In his free time, Angelo has continued graphic design work since his days at the newspaper, and now has over 10-years’ experience working with Adobe CC on freelance and personal projects. He also loves music, and after spending years as a music journalist, he stage managed for some of North America’s largest summer festivals.</p>
			
			<p>Originally from Toronto but now married to a native Chicagoan, he dreads any potential games between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs or Bulls and Raptors. At least we can all agree on Drake.
